This project is about dorking around with MapReduce, it contains a set of Mappers, Reducers and some MRUnit test code.  Several of the examples go with my [Fun with MapReduce](http://www.corbettworks.net/blog/categories/funwithmapreduce/) blog postings, where I attempt to work my way through the MapReduce fog.
